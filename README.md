This C++ program helps vegetarian weightlifters plan and evaluate their daily and weekly nutrition. It generates personalized macro recommendations based on the user’s calorie goals, meal frequency, and weekly workout hours, while offering feedback to support strength-training performance.

The multiple function types guide users through validated input prompts, displays results with formatted console output (including Windows console colors), and generates a complete nutrition report.

Key Features
- Structured Menu Navigation: Switch-based menu with options to view macros, generate reports, check nutrition, or start a new session.
- Improved Input Validation (New This Week): Enhanced string, integer, and double validation with clear error handling and buffer cleanup.
- Console Color Output (New This Week): Uses Windows API to highlight headers, errors, and recipe sections.
- Dynamic Macro Calculations: Computes daily macros, per-meal targets, and weekly totals using constants and reference parameters.
- Formatted Report Generation (Updated): Creates a clean, aligned report.txt file summarizing all calculations and user inputs.
- Activity-Based Feedback: Provides calorie and meal-frequency evaluations based on workout hours.
- Use of Core C++ Fundamentals: Demonstrates loops (while, for, do...while), functions, constants, file output, and input handling.
